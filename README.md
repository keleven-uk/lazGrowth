# lazGrowth

 Trying to simulate organic growth, using Lazarus.

A organic structure is grown by repeatably setting off a random walk and colouring the point where is hits the growing structure.

The growth is saved in a text file, so can be loaded and continued at any time.

The current growth can be saved as a bitmap.

The growth is drawn using per pixel to the screen, I'm sure this can [and will be] done faster.
