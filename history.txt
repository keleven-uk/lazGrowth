commit 4a5fe065fbebc251f845d8e3d41807de19b7f89a
Author: keleven-uk <github@keleven.co.uk>

    Added pointStore - this is a class that will store a series of points
    [x, y].  It allows point to be pushed onto the store and pop's off, from
    a given position within the store.  The class can also load and save the
    store to text file.
    
    Th epointStore is used twice, one to remember the random walk and one to
    remember the hits [parts of the growth].
    
    Added routines to main program to load the growth from file, clear the
    tail upon a new hit and to display hits per min.
